If the Temporal Bow bends to a previous point in time to a point when things were more orderly, logic would dictate that we are making this point more chaotic by taking things from it. All known laws of the natural universe suggests that this should have affected our Present Day, but all evidence points to that not being true. It appears the theory that we cannot change our past was incorrect!\n\nThis suggests that Time is, in fact, not an arrow but several arrows, each pointing different directions. Fundamentally, this proves the existence of other timelines - different dimensions - some of which we can assume have also built their own Temporal Bow.\n\nThe promise of crossing this final dimensional threshold is too tempting.
