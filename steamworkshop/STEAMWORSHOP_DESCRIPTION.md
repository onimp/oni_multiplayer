# Welcome to the Oxygen Not Included Multiplayer Mod!
With this mod, all players share controls over a single colony. You and your friends work together to make decisions collectively. Both of you controls all duplicants and assign tasks to them. However players are not coupled to the same view, each player can look and control differents parts of the world, while actions will be synced.

## Current Stage and Status
Status: In development </br>
Stage: Alpha

## What's Implemented
- Multiplayer functionality currently tested in Vanilla Oxygen Not Included (NO DLC).
- Synced UI elements, including colony settings, game settings, building dialogs, and tools.
- Additional in-game UI: loading overlays, showing players information and synchronization error diagnostics.
- Periodic hard syncs to avoid accumulated errors, with hard sync on each server save action.

## What's Not Implemented
 - Syncronisation of duplicants (planned for future updates).
 - Support for DLC content (planned for future updates).
 - Different game mods (e.g. living on different asteroids, controlling different dupes, etc).
