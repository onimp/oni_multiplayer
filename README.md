# ONI multiplayer mod (WORK IN PROGRESS / PROTOTYPE)

This is a mod which adds multiplayer support to Oxygen not included game.

## Current stage and status

Status: In development
Stage: Early WIP and proof of concept

Working functionality:

- Currently tested in Vanilla only (NO DLC)
- Basic main menu UI
  - Join/Load/Create MP game
- Ability to join/invite friends via Steam overlay UI
- Showing cursor of all active players
- Syncing user actions (dig/build/mop/harvest/etc and other from bottom toolbar)
- Syncing warp settings and pause
- Additional diagnostic showing amount of synchronization error
  - Always 0 on the server side
  - Huge on any client :)
- Every mornings hard syncs to avoid accumulated errors
- Hard sync on any server save

## Game mechanics

All players play all together and share controls over a single colony. Order given by a player might be overruled by
another.
<p>There is no difference between different players, all players are equal.
It is possible to look and control different asteroids at the same time as well.

## Under the hood mechanics idea

Idea is based on the assumption that the game engine will run ~~the same~~ **similar** without any user input even on
different
machines.
<p>So if user input will be the same on different machines - then their separate simulations should run the same.
<p>To avoid accumulated errors (if any) it is proposed to do periodic (one per game day) hard syncs by loading game save
files.
<p>Additional support is required for minions since their logic is separate from the world state their behavior is differnt on different machines.

<p>[Optional] To make smoother experience or if simulations will be running too different it is feasible to do periodic
small world syncs for smaller areas of different layers (e.g. sync gases within an area 16x16 every 30 seconds).

## How to install

To install locally copy release content (with folder) to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Local (if
some folders are missing, please create them).

## How to use

### Host:

- Host a game either via 'New multiplayer game' or via 'Load multiplayer game'
- Wait until the game is loaded and overlay is opened automatically
- Invite friends via Steam overlay

### Player/Friend:

- Run the game first
- Join invite (from already opened game) or join via Steam overlay
- Wait until game is loaded

# Long TODO List

- Basic features
    - [MAJOR] Handle game user actions
        - Handle building
            - Most of the builds are synced
            - Pipes, wires, vents are NOT synced at all
        - Handle buildings settings (side dialog actions)
        - Handle colonies settings (food/priorities/etc)
    - [MAJOR] Printer is not synced
    - [MAJOR] Minions behaviour is totally different on different clients
    - [MINOR] Performance assessment (network/memory/cpu)
- Improvements
    - [MAJOR] Measuring amount of out-dated objects in more graceful way
        - Currently it shows absolute diff to the frame. But some amount of difference is fine (e.g. progress of
          building diff less then X percent, or temperature difference less then Y degrees)
    - [MEDIUM] Correctly handling DLC vs Vanilla game versions
    - [MEDIUM] Launching game straight away
        - Right now it shows a warning about wrong url format
    - [MINOR] InGame Players information
        - Who is in the game
        - Where they are
        - Their ping
        - Ability to kick/vote for kick
    - [MINOR] In game Lobby browser
    - [MINOR] Translation support
- Bux fixes
    - [MAJOR] Every synced build action clutters another player side
    - [MEDIUM] Some actions (as Build action) overrides user selected building plan/material/priorirt
    - [MEDIUM] Cursor draw method is error prone (double phantom cursors, inverted, etc)
    - [MINOR] Correct handling of UI buttons (e.g. clicking create -> cancel -> join causes client to join but with
      additional
      server :) )
- GitHub
    - [MAJOR] Better README
    - [MEDIUM] Better issue categories :)
    - [MINOR] Build and code cleanup
