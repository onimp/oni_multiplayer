# ONI multiplayer mod (WORK IN PROGRESS / PROTOTYPE)

This is a mod which adds multiplayer support to Oxygen not included game.

## Current stage and status

Status: In development
Stage: Early WIP and proof of concept

Working functionality:

- Currently tested in Vanilla only (NO DLC)
- Basic main menu UI
  - Join/Load/Create MP game
- Ability to join/invite friends via Steam overlay UI
- Showing cursor of all active players
- Syncing user actions (dig/build/mop/harvest/etc and other from bottom toolbar)
- Syncing warp settings and pause
- Additional diagnostic showing amount of synchronization error
  - Always 0 on the server side
  - Huge on any client :)
- Every mornings hard syncs to avoid accumulated errors
- Hard sync on any server save

## Game mechanics

All players play all together and share controls over a single colony. Order given by a player might be overruled by
another.
<p>There is no difference between different players, all players are equal.
It is possible to look and control different asteroids at the same time as well.

## Under the hood mechanics idea

Idea is based on the assumption that the game engine will run ~~the same~~ **similar** without any user input even on
different
machines.
<p>So if user input will be the same on different machines - then their separate simulations should run the same.
<p>To avoid accumulated errors (if any) it is proposed to do periodic (one per game day) hard syncs by loading game save
files.
<p>Additional support is required for minions since their logic is separate from the world state their behavior is differnt on different machines.

<p>[Optional] To make smoother experience or if simulations will be running too different it is feasible to do periodic
small world syncs for smaller areas of different layers (e.g. sync gases within an area 16x16 every 30 seconds).

## How to install

To install locally copy release content (with folder) to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Local (if
